    # It should implement the following methods:
    # __init__(self, a, b, n)
    # integrate(self, f)
    pass

class Midpoint:
    # TODO-2 Let this class inherit from the class Quadrature.
    # It should inherit the __init__ and integrate methods from Quadrature (You don't have to define them again).
    # It should define the construct method by itself.

class Trapezoidal:
    # TODO-3 Do the same as in TODO-2 for class Trapezoidal.

class MonteCarlo:
    # TODO-4 This new class should be really easy to implement now.
