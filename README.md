Einf√ºhrung in die wissenschaftliche Programmierung (Winter term 2014/15)
========================================================================

This website contains supplemental material for Johannes' tutorial.

In the tutorial, I'll first skip over the most important material again. Then, we try to tackle the exercises on the exercise sheet together. During the class I want you to program the exercises by yourself. You can do it on your own laptop, together in a team, or write it on paper.

If you have any problems, I'm there to help you.
